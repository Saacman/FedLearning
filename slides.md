# Paillier Encryption

 - Paillier is a type of public-key cryptosystem that supports additive homomorphic encryption.
 - Homomorphic encryption is a type of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without having to decrypt it first
 - Additive homomorphic encryption specifically allows the addition of two encrypted values to yield an encrypted result that, when decrypted, is equal to the sum of the original values.
